Webmail Upgrade
=====================

The BC Libraries Cooperative will be upgrading our webmail server on Sunday August 23rd from 9:00pm to 12:00am PDT.  The webmail server will be unavailable during the upgrade.

We do not expect any changes to your login credentials, the webmail user interface, or the way in which you get your email.

Please contact the Co-op at sysop@bc.libraries.coop or call Co-op Support at 1-888-848-9250 if you experience any issues with your webmail once the upgrade is complete.
