Due to an inadvertent problem with a network router that resulted in DNS issues, servers hosted
by the Co-op (including, but not limited to Sitka, Libpress, mail and Licensing authentication
sources) were temporarily unreachable today between 9:15 and 11am PDT.

This issue has now been resolved, we sincerely apologize for the interruption in service.
Please feel free to contact the Co-op's Systems Manager Scott Leslie at
scott.leslie@bc.libraries.coop with any questions or concerns.
