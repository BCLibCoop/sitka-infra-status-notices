The BC Libraries Cooperative advises we can no longer support the use of
Internet Explorer 6. There is a [recently discovered security flaw in SSL v3,
Security Socket
Layer](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/poodle-ssl-3-0-bug-is-the-newest-threat-to-web-security-1.2799078),
on which IE 6 relies, and which is not fixable in that browser. We will disable
SSL v3 on the co-op servers by end of business Friday October 17, 2014. If your
library has any computers running Internet Explorer 6, you MUST upgrade (to IE
8, or alternatively switch to the latest Firefox) by Friday October 17 in order
to connect to Co-op servers. Other modern web browsers now rely on a newer form
of encryption and so are unaffected.

Please contact co-op support at sitka@bc.libraries.coop if you have any
questions.
