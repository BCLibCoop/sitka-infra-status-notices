The BC Libraries Cooperative advises we can no longer support the use of
Internet Explorer on Windows XP. Due to numerous issues with Windows XP and the
discontinance of Microsoft support for Windows XP, the Cooperative will no
longer ensure that Internet Explorer on Windows XP works after Tuesday, June
30, 2015.

This will impact all library and patron systems attempting to access any
Cooperative-hosted website. A limited systems may continue to work, but such
access will not be supported in any way.

Any affected systems should either have an OS upgrade, or switch to using
another browser, such as Firefox or Chrome.
